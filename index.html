    <h1>My Interest in Information Technology</h1>

<p>My interest in information technology began at a very early age through the medium of video games. Although I never grew up with the most up to date platforms it never deterred me from not only enjoying the process of gaming, but also my interest into what could be achieved next with technology.<br>After years of playing on platforms such as the Sega Master System II, NES and Super Nintendo I was lucky enough to receive a Nintendo 64, albeit a few years after its release. I still remember unboxing it, setting it up and firing up Mario 64 for the first time. It was like I was sitting right there in the future!<br>I have a continued love of video games, having spent most of my early twenties collecting as many platform and games that I played as a child. However, I can say that my interest in information technology has evolved over the years, much like the technology itself.<br>Nowadays I am extremely interested in the functions of certain applications and the impact they have on my everyday routines, the way the household has become so integrated with technology, and the improvements in the way we are able to communicate.<br>These interests helped me in my previous career in the print industry where technology evolved rapidly in a relatively short period of time. This came in the form of calibration and measuring equipment and the software associated with it, to the adaptation of the digital print world. Familiarising myself with software and hardware was essential as it had a direct impact on the product we were able to produce.<br>
<br><strong>Studying Information Technology</strong><br>   
<br>When deciding to study the subject of Information Technology it was a bit overwhelming choosing where to go as everybody offered what seemed to be similar core values and content.<br>The two reasons I chose RMIT were its reputation amongst graduating students and its sheer flexibility of study. To be able to study and interact with like-minded people in the subject from the comfort of my home on the other side of the country is invaluable.<br>After my studies are complete, I would expect to be able to apply knowledge of complex IT ideas and situations and be able to communicate with both professionals and people without any IT experience on a wide range of related topics. In learning these skills, I believe I will be able to be an effective team member in a variety of IT related fields. </p>
    
    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    
<p>It is extremely difficult to pinpoint what I believe my ideal job would be so early on in my studies. I have not yet been able to identify my strengths and weaknesses in the field therefore would have to make my decision purely on my current interests and aspirations, rather than what I believe I would be most suited for.</p>
<p><strong>Data and Reporting Analyst</strong></p>

<p>The role of a Data and Report Analyst is to contribute to organisational improvement by utilising their skills in gathering and analysing data, preparing reports, and introducing process improvements throughout the reporting process.<br>For this specific role it would entail taking those skills and attributes and applying them to the processes already in place to be able to communicate information with senior stakeholders.<br>This role is appealing to me for several reasons including my interest in data’s role in problem solving however, I believe that it is the mix of technical processes and communicating results in a business situation that excites me most. Being able to be proficient in both areas and the learning required to get there is exciting and motivating.</p> 
<p>To even be considered for a role like this I would need extensive experience with business intelligence and the associated concepts and methods along with the relative software currently in use by the hirer ie. Microsoft BI technology stack. I would also require previous experience in database development and a proven track record working as a BI Analyst, Data Warehouse Specialist or ETL Developer.<br>The skills that I currently possess that are required for the role are my communication skills, business acumen and engagement with stakeholders. These skills that I possess may not currently be up to the standards of this specific role however as my study and experiences progress I believe that they will only strengthen and develop as I do not have to build a foundation from scratch.</p>
<p>To be able to be considered for this role, or any like it, I will need to develop the technical aspects through study, both at a tertiary level and of my own. Once I am technically proficient, I would be able to begin a career as a graduate level data analyst and gain the relative work and technical experience required.<br>I would need to focus on my employment role as well as developing my skills with different software and processes outside of my employment as it would not be guaranteed that the work experience alone would be sufficient. It would in no means be a quick journey however I believe with the right mind set and enthusiasm to reach a desired position it would be a fulfilling one.</p>

    Yet Protagonists can be easily tripped up in areas where idealism and altruism are more of a liability than an asset.

    <blockquote cite=" http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=7&V=7&T=6">
    <i>'<strong> Auditory</strong><br>
    If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you must hear it or speak it in order to know it.<br>
    As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.<br><br>
    <strong>Visual</strong><br>
    If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.<br>
    As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoke language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.'</i>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>The results of these tests suggest that when working in a team environment I could be tolerant, reliable, charismatic and possess the traits of somebody who could lead. All these would be positive additions to a team setting however the tests also indicate I could be prone to being too selfless, struggle to make tough decisions and become distracted easily should I lose interest in any given topic.<br><br>
    With this information presented in the way that it is I will able to try and utilise the strengths outlined in the results but also work on and be aware of the weaknesses presented also. By actively keeping this in mind while forming a team I would be able to find likeminded individuals making the possibility of avoidable conflict/issues far less probable. The accuracy of these tests cannot be trusted wholly however and should not be the sole factor to take into consideration when it comes to selecting a team to work with.</p>

<h1>My Project Idea</h1> 

    <p>I would like to develop a social golf, smartphone app using appypie appmakr or a similar app creating tool, if this isn’t possible the use of a specialised app developer may be required.<br> The app would not just be a standard shot counting and sharing app but a tool to be able to map each shot on any given hole on any given course, enabling the ability to not only share your score with friends but giving them the ability to track where the shots actually took place on the course. This would be able to provide a more visual take on the traditional score card and be a more professional view at how a round of golf is played.<br>
    <br>The motivation for this idea comes after years of frustration from being able to share scores amongst friends but not really being able to have a grasp on how a round of golf was played, outside what was verbally said amongst each other.<br>I began making notes on my scorecards as to give more insight into my own rounds however, after time the notes became dated as my memory could not recall the specifics of what I had written down.<br>The ability to be able to not only put a visual aspect to a golf score but the ability to share it easily amongst friends is a key driver behind this idea.<br>
    <br>The app would have a catalogue of course maps which the user would be able to access prior to their round from a menu. After selecting the desired course that is being played the user will tee off and then mark a spot on the course, via GPS location, before each subsequent shot. <br>By marking this spot, a marker icon is placed on the hole map where the location of the shot was taken measuring the distance of the previous shot at the same time. The player marks each approach shot until reaching the green where the user inputs how many putts were needed to complete hole. <br>This not only tabulates the score for the hole but does not leave a mass of marker points in the one area of the hole map making it hard to decipher. This is repeated for the remainder of the round and saved upon completion. <br>The player is then able to go back through their completed round and see where the shots played throughout the full round were taken. Using the marker points and putts input the app will also express key stats of the round such as longest drive, greens in regulation and total putts per hole average.<br>
    <br>These features would be extremely beneficial for a golfer who wishes to visualise, analyse, and compare each round. This makes it an extremely useful training tool as it would put a visual aspect to the progress made over a period of time, something not attainable simply by tracking the amount of shots taken.<br> The ability to not only save and catalogue the results but also share them creates a social aspect wherein the user can share their rounds and progress with other users. From this, users will be able to compare shot types, distances, and even how other users play the course and the shots they choose to play. <br>Golf is an extremely popular sport, roughly 36% of Americans (over 107 million people) play, so the ability to choose whether the user shares their results publicly or just amongst friends would be an option. For those willing to share publicly their rounds would be visible by all users whereas those choosing to only share their scores amongst friends, their scores would only be shared to approved friends on the app itself. The option to not share at all would also be accessible.<br>
    <br>While in theory all of this sounds like it would be an extremely useful app there are certainly some obstacles to overcome in making it viable.<br>The sheer amount of playable golf courses around the world raises the immediate issue of creating a map database large enough where the app could be widely used. Course map artwork and distances would be hard to gather and verify meaning a lot of it would depend on peer approval and suggestions which would be hard to achieve within a brand-new app.<br>One other problem that arises is the likelihood of the user carrying their phone and accessing it around a golf course, this would possibly mean the need of incorporating a smart watch app to accompany it or a specific bit of hardware that connects to the app in which the user accesses instead of the smartphone itself.<br>
    <br>The app itself would be highly reliant on GPS technologies, which if accessed via an iPhone in optimal conditions would be accurate enough to give an approximate marking, albeit not a perfect one. <br>
    <blockquote cite="https://itstillworks.com/accurate-iphone-gps-18419.html ">
    <i>‘The GPS on an iPhone is an assisted GPS system; it uses other reference sources in addition to the signal generated by the Global Positioning System satellites to pinpoint the exact location of the device.<br> The more signal sources the iPhone can access for this purpose, the more accurate it becomes. In optimal conditions, the iPhone GPS is accurate to within a few meters. The longer you keep an application that uses the GPS feature open on an iPhone, the more your accuracy increases. <br>The more satellite signals the iPhone locks onto, the more accurate the results are. When using the location services on the phone, the GPS continually tries to pick up additional signals. If it succeeds, the accuracy of the results improves as a result.’</i> (How Accurate Is an iPhone GPS?, 2020)
    </blockquote>
    <br>The skills required to produce such a product would rest heavily in the realm of app development and design. Focus on the design features and layout are paramount however making sure to only work on the core needs of the app initially is essential. This would reduce costing and help get the app on the market quicker. Updates would then be able to be provided as extra features were able to be introduced.<br>Due to the complexity of making as many courses available as possible the initial app would have to focus on a specific region and expand from there to make it feasible, the app will grow as the volume of users grows.<br>
    <br>As ambitious as it is to make an app like this, I believe it will have a profound impact on how rounds of golf are discussed amongst friends and fellow players. The ability to add the visual aspect to a score card opens the door for critique and comparison, something heavily valued in golfers.<br> The main concern however is availability to users, it would have to be only developed for a specific region initially and then expanded on, as interest and want for the app grows so would the areas it would be available.</p>

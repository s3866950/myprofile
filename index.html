    <h1>My Interest in Information Technology</h1>

<p>My interest in information technology began at a very early age through the medium of video games. Although I never grew up with the most up to date platforms it never deterred me from not only enjoying the process of gaming, but also my interest into what could be achieved next with technology.<br>After years of playing on platforms such as the Sega Master System II, NES and Super Nintendo I was lucky enough to receive a Nintendo 64, albeit a few years after its release. I still remember unboxing it, setting it up and firing up Mario 64 for the first time. It was like I was sitting right there in the future!<br>I have a continued love of video games, having spent most of my early twenties collecting as many platform and games that I played as a child. However, I can say that my interest in information technology has evolved over the years, much like the technology itself.<br>Nowadays I am extremely interested in the functions of certain applications and the impact they have on my everyday routines, the way the household has become so integrated with technology, and the improvements in the way we are able to communicate.<br>These interests helped me in my previous career in the print industry where technology evolved rapidly in a relatively short period of time. This came in the form of calibration and measuring equipment and the software associated with it, to the adaptation of the digital print world. Familiarising myself with software and hardware was essential as it had a direct impact on the product we were able to produce. </p>
<p><strong>Studying Information Technology</strong></p>   
<p>When deciding to study the subject of Information Technology it was a bit overwhelming choosing where to go as everybody offered what seemed to be similar core values and content.<br>The two reasons I chose RMIT were its reputation amongst graduating students and its sheer flexibility of study. To be able to study and interact with like-minded people in the subject from the comfort of my home on the other side of the country is invaluable.<br>After my studies are complete, I would expect to be able to apply knowledge of complex IT ideas and situations and be able to communicate with both professionals and people without any IT experience on a wide range of related topics. In learning these skills, I believe I will be able to be an effective team member in a variety of IT related fields. </p>
    
    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    
<p>It is extremely difficult to pinpoint what I believe my ideal job would be so early on in my studies. I have not yet been able to identify my strengths and weaknesses in the field therefore would have to make my decision purely on my current interests and aspirations, rather than what I believe I would be most suited for.</p>

    <h1>My Interest in Information Technology</h1>

<p>My interest in information technology began at a very early age through the medium of video games. Although I never grew up with the most up to date platforms it never deterred me from not only enjoying the process of gaming, but also my interest into what could be achieved next with technology.<br>After years of playing on platforms such as the Sega Master System II, NES and Super Nintendo I was lucky enough to receive a Nintendo 64, albeit a few years after its release. I still remember unboxing it, setting it up and firing up Mario 64 for the first time. It was like I was sitting right there in the future!<br>I have a continued love of video games, having spent most of my early twenties collecting as many platform and games that I played as a child. However, I can say that my interest in information technology has evolved over the years, much like the technology itself.<br>Nowadays I am extremely interested in the functions of certain applications and the impact they have on my everyday routines, the way the household has become so integrated with technology, and the improvements in the way we are able to communicate.<br>These interests helped me in my previous career in the print industry where technology evolved rapidly in a relatively short period of time. This came in the form of calibration and measuring equipment and the software associated with it, to the adaptation of the digital print world. Familiarising myself with software and hardware was essential as it had a direct impact on the product we were able to produce. </p>
<p><strong>Studying Information Technology</strong></p>   
<p>When deciding to study the subject of Information Technology it was a bit overwhelming choosing where to go as everybody offered what seemed to be similar core values and content.<br>The two reasons I chose RMIT were its reputation amongst graduating students and its sheer flexibility of study. To be able to study and interact with like-minded people in the subject from the comfort of my home on the other side of the country is invaluable.<br>After my studies are complete, I would expect to be able to apply knowledge of complex IT ideas and situations and be able to communicate with both professionals and people without any IT experience on a wide range of related topics. In learning these skills, I believe I will be able to be an effective team member in a variety of IT related fields. </p>
    
    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    
<p>It is extremely difficult to pinpoint what I believe my ideal job would be so early on in my studies. I have not yet been able to identify my strengths and weaknesses in the field therefore would have to make my decision purely on my current interests and aspirations, rather than what I believe I would be most suited for.</p>
<p><strong>Data and Reporting Analyst</strong></p>

<p>The role of a Data and Report Analyst is to contribute to organisational improvement by utilising their skills in gathering and analysing data, preparing reports, and introducing process improvements throughout the reporting process.<br>For this specific role it would entail taking those skills and attributes and applying them to the processes already in place to be able to communicate information with senior stakeholders.<br>This role is appealing to me for several reasons including my interest in data’s role in problem solving however, I believe that it is the mix of technical processes and communicating results in a business situation that excites me most. Being able to be proficient in both areas and the learning required to get there is exciting and motivating.</p> 
<p>To even be considered for a role like this I would need extensive experience with business intelligence and the associated concepts and methods along with the relative software currently in use by the hirer ie. Microsoft BI technology stack. I would also require previous experience in database development and a proven track record working as a BI Analyst, Data Warehouse Specialist or ETL Developer.<br>The skills that I currently possess that are required for the role are my communication skills, business acumen and engagement with stakeholders. These skills that I possess may not currently be up to the standards of this specific role however as my study and experiences progress I believe that they will only strengthen and develop as I do not have to build a foundation from scratch.</p>
<p>To be able to be considered for this role, or any like it, I will need to develop the technical aspects through study, both at a tertiary level and of my own. Once I am technically proficient, I would be able to begin a career as a graduate level data analyst and gain the relative work and technical experience required.<br>I would need to focus on my employment role as well as developing my skills with different software and processes outside of my employment as it would not be guaranteed that the work experience alone would be sufficient. It would in no means be a quick journey however I believe with the right mind set and enthusiasm to reach a desired position it would be a fulfilling one.</p>

    <i>'Few personality types are as inspiring and charismatic as Protagonists. Their idealism and vision allow Protagonists to overcome many challenging obstacles, more often than not brightening the lives of those around them. Protagonists’ imagination is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.<br>
    Yet Protagonists can be easily tripped up in areas where idealism and altruism are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, staying calm under pressure, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder or making difficult decisions, Protagonists need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.'</i>

    <blockquote cite=" http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=7&V=7&T=6">
    <i>'<strong> Auditory</strong><br>
    If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you must hear it or speak it in order to know it.<br>
    As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.<br><br>
    <strong>Visual</strong><br>
    If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.<br>
    As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoke language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.'</i>

<p><strong>How Creative am I? Assessment</strong></p><br>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>The results of these tests suggest that when working in a team environment I could be tolerant, reliable, charismatic and possess the traits of somebody who could lead. All these would be positive additions to a team setting however the tests also indicate I could be prone to being too selfless, struggle to make tough decisions and become distracted easily should I lose interest in any given topic.<br><br>
    With this information presented in the way that it is I will able to try and utilise the strengths outlined in the results but also work on and be aware of the weaknesses presented also. By actively keeping this in mind while forming a team I would be able to find likeminded individuals making the possibility of avoidable conflict/issues far less probable. The accuracy of these tests cannot be trusted wholly however and should not be the sole factor to take into consideration when it comes to selecting a team to work with.</p>
